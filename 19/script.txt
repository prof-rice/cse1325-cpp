#### Slides 1-21 - Memory leaks and casting

00_no_poly.cpp: Base + Derived with print(), call 3 ways including "polymorphic"

01_no_override.cpp: Add override

02_virtual.cpp: Add virtual

03_ref_ptr.cpp: Make base &, then * - WORKS!

#### Slide 34 - Define polymorphism

10_parameters.cpp: Add print_copy, _ref, _ptr; call each with a Base and a Derived

#### Slide 40-42 - what's happening with memory

11_returns.cpp: Instance Derived with method _copy, _ref, _ptr and assign to base

20_operator.cpp: Dump the methods, add operator<< to Base and Derived that print name
    Instance and print a Base, Derived, and a Derived as a Base reference - last one FAILS!
    Functions are NEVER polymorphic!

21_operator_fixed.cpp: Replace literal in Base's operator<< with polymorphic call to print()
    DELETE Derived's operator<<.  NO changes to main(). WORKS!

#### Slide 43-46 - dynamic_cast
